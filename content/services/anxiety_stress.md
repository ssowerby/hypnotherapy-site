Anxiety is the pits. Being restricted in the places you can go or what you can do. Feeling you have to avoid certain people, places or situations. It's like a prison you carry around with you, on some level it can be there all the time, gnawing at your thoughts, keeping you awake at night. When you're not doing whatever it is that makes you anxious you may well be thinking about it and feeling anxious anyway. It's exhausting and you've put up with it for too long.

How many of these questions can you answer yes to?

* Do you **excessively ruminate** on the past and/or fear the future? 
* Do certain **situations make you anxious** or maybe you are **generally anxious**?
* In certain situations are you **overwhelmed by panic**?
* Do certain memories or experiences make you** fearful**? 
* Do you find it **difficult to ever relax**?
* Have you tried talking yourself out of feeling anxious but it's not working?
* Have you ever been told 'dont' worry, just relax' and felt like punching someone?

If you could choose to 'just relax' you would but you haven't chosen to feel anxious either. With hypnosis I can help you to reprogramme that part of your mind which is creating this anxious reaction so you can **be relaxed in those times that used to make you anxious**. 

**Imagine what life will look like when you're calm and relaxed more of the time?** What it will be like to go wherever you want without worrying about how you'll feel or what people will think? To actually **look forward to the future**.  What little or big things will you be doing differently? Imagine how much **more choice you'll have in life**.

At particular times a level of anxiety is appropriate to keep us alert and safe. The problem comes when your spidey senses are set off by situations that really arenâ€™t harmful or are indeed being set off all the time by almost everything. When this happens hypnosis can help to retune your spidey sense so you can **feel calm** in those situations, **cope better with uncertainty, look forward to future** events and **feel safer** more of the time. And that can make such a big difference to your everyday life.
