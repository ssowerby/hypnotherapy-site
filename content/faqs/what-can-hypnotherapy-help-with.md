title: What can hypnotherapy help with?
---
Hypnotherapy can help with any problem that would be eased by a change in perspective, thinking or feeling. For example a phobia can be helped with hypnosis because when you don't have the fear any more it's not a problem. Similarly social anxiety or low self-esteem are no longer a problem when you feel, calm relaxed and comfortable in your own skin.
