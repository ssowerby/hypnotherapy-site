title: About Me
---
I love working with people one to one to help them improve their lives. My particular interest is working with anxiety, lack of confidence and low self esteem. Helping people to feel comfortable in their own skin in situations where they used to feel anxiety or lack confident. 

I'm not into watch swinging or clucking like a chicken. If you're looking for an authoritarian style hypnotherapist to command you to 'be better' that really isn't my bag. The modern form of hypnotherapy I use very much puts you the client in the driving seat. I use my expertise to guide you through hypnosis but your experience will be unique to you, you are in control. It's the style which I enjoyed myself when I was the client as I don't know about you but I don't like being ordered around.
