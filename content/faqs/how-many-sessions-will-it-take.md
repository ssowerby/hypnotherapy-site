title: How many sessions will it take?
---
It really depends on the issue and the individual person. Hypnotherapy is usually quite a short term therapy unlike counselling or psychotherapy. Two to four sessions is often sufficient for many people although there are exceptions. (The equivalent of less than a day to make a significant change to your life.) You should notice a difference from each session which will let you know that you're making progress.
