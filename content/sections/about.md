I'm not into watch swinging or clucking like a chicken. If you're looking for an authoritarian style hypnotherapist to command you to 'be better' that really isn't my bag. The modern form of hypnotherapy I use very much puts you the client in the driving seat. I use my expertise to guide you through hypnosis but your experience will be unique to you.
