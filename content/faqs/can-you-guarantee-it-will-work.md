title: Can you guarantee it will work?
---
A sports coach can't guarantee one of her students will succeed she can only share her expertise with the athlete who must run the race themselves. Hypnotherapy is not something a hypnotherapist 'does' to you. It's a partnership between the two of you, both working towards a common goal. I will do my best to help you by bring all my training and experience to bear and you will bring a willingness to change and to commit to the process. That gives us a very good chance of success but it's not a guarantee. However you should notice a difference from each session which will let you know that you're progressing in the right direction.
