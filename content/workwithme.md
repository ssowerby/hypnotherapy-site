title: Working with me
---
I know what it's like to always be thinking about what other people are thinking of you. To act (or more usually not act) from a place of fear, to be too eager to please and too scared to be seen. It's something that's difficult to rationalise yourself out of because you already know it's not rational. You're not on the FBI's most wanted list but you're always ready to feel guilty at the drop of a hat. 

I first became fascinated with the mind when looking at my own irrational thoughts and feelings. I became a hypnotherapist because it enables me to work with that part of the brain that logic alone can't reach. To be able to make changes at a deep level of feeling which is beyond words but drives how we react and interact in the world. Hypnosis is almost like resetting the levels back to the factory default before life happened and those unhelpful ideas and feelings got into your head. It's been a fascinating journey so far seeing how something so simple and natural acan make such a difference to how a person experiences themselves and the world. I get to see people thrive and flourish being themselves and to me that's the most rewarding job I could have.

#### You're stuck right?

You've probably tried to make changes on your own. Maybe you've been faking it but not making it or affirming your socks off without success. Sure you could read some more books and try some more stuff on your own but we all need a bit of help from someone else sometimes. 

If you're ready to ask for help I'm here to give it. I work with people like you either in person or online depending on your preference. We're talking short term help not a long term commitment. I've helped people like you make a big change in just 4 sessions. [Find out about the Be The Youest You Programme](/programme/) 

#### What happens in a session?

All sessions start with an informal chat about where you are now and what you want to achieve. Everyone is different and it's important for me to understand what's affecting you in particular and what you want to get out of our sessions together. If this isn't your first session we'll also review what's improved since the last session.

This is followed by a session of hypnosis. Hypnosis is really just a state of inward focussed attention (see more in FAQs) which I help you relax into by telling you a story or talking you through some relaxing exercises using your imagination. You will continue to be fully aware during the hypnosis session itself which will involve following along with exercises using your imagination and listening to me talk and make suggestions. It's a very relaxed state and you may find your mind wandering which is perfectly normal.

Following the hypnosis session we gently reorientate you to the room (it can feel a bit like waking up after a sleep as you've been still and quiet for a while). Then I may end the session with some suggestions for relaxation or other exercises for you to do at home between sessions. 
If you haven't experienced hypnosis before you'll be surprised how familiar and relaxing it feels.
