title: What happens in a session?
---
All sessions start with an informal chat about where you are now and what you want to achieve. Everyone is different and it's important for me to understand what's affecting you in particular and what you want to get out of our sessions together. If this isn't your first session we'll also review what's improved since the last session.

This is followed by a session of hypnosis. Hypnosis is really just a state of inward focussed attention (see more in FAQs) which I help you relax into by telling you a story or talking you through some relaxing exercises using your imagination. You will continue to be fully aware during the hypnosis session itself which will involve following along with exercises using your imagination and listening to me talk and make suggestions. It's a very relaxed state and you may find your mind wandering which is perfectly normal.

Following the hypnosis session we gently reorientate you to the room (it can feel a bit like waking up after a sleep as you've been still and quiet for a while). Then I may end the session with some suggestions for relaxation or other exercises for you to do at home between sessions. 
If you haven't experienced hypnosis before you'll be surprised how familiar and relaxing it feels.
