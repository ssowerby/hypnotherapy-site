title: Where do sessions take place?
---
I practice hypnotherapy in Crystal Palace, on the triangle, convenient for Norwood and Beckenham, a 15 minute walk from Crystal Palace station. 

I also offer hypnosis sessions near Spitalfields and Shoreditch in Liverpool Street/Bishopsgate, EC2M, 5 minutes walk from both Liverpool Street Station and Spitalfields or alternatively 15 minutes walk from Shoreditch Station.
