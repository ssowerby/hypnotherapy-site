title: What is hypnosis?
---
Hypnosis is a trance state where you can change your habits, behaviours and thinking.

Trance is a natural state we each experience every day. A state of inner focus some people call the ‘zone’. Reading a gripping book unaware of the room you’re sitting in, practicing a favourite sport without realising how much time is passing or flowing through your work unaware of colleagues talking around you, these are all trance states. It’s a state in which you are so absorbed in what you’re doing that you become less aware of your surroundings. As you’ll know it’s a great state for getting work done, improving your game or indeed relaxing. So it’s not too much of a leap to realise it’s also a really affective state for learning new things and solving problems.

In a hypnotherapy session the hypnotherapist will help to guide you into a relaxed hypnotic state. You will still be aware of your surroundings but your attention will be drawn more to what is happening inside your own mind. While in hypnosis the hypnotherapist will then help you to engage your imagination to see your issue from different perspectives to help you make the changes you want.
