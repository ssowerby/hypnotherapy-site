Phobias and irrational fears can affect anyone anytime, **you're not alone**.  People can have phobias about anything from flying to buttons. Is you fear having a big influence on your life? 



A phobia of public speaking could be keeping you from advancing at work or a phobia of spiders keeping you exhausted and on high alert all the time. You may feel embarrassed about a fear that when you say it out loud sounds ridiculous or you may be aware of a logical reason for where it comes from. Either way you may be spending a lot of time trying to work around your phobia, avoiding people, places or situations, making excuses to others. **Managing a phobia can feel like a full time job** in itself. Hypnosis can help you to convince your mind that there is no threat so it can stop triggering the fear.



**Imagine what it will be like to not have that old fear.** To wake up in the morning without giving it a thought. To plan your day, your week, your life without having to take it into account. No more preparing excuses for why you can't do something. No more anxiety or dread that it could happen any time. Being able to **say yes to more opportunities**. **Relaxing more** of the time, **being in the moment** and **enjoying life** more.



You're not choosing to feel this way but the subconscious part of you is choosing it for you. For some reason it really believes there is danger and it thinks it's doing you a favour by filling you with terror and making you avoid it. You may have tried rationalising with yourself about it to no avail. You know it's not dangerous but you still feel that it is. **With hypnosis we can reach that part of your mind which is triggering the fear.**



Hypnosis is a great tool for changing feelings. Working with your subconscious mind together we can change the associations your mind has so **that old fear trigger is not identified as a threat** any more and those old feelings are no longer. It's a **calm and gentle process** which most people find quite pleasant.
