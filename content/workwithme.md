title: Working with me
---
Hi I'm Rachel, I know what it's like to always be thinking about what other people are thinking of you. To act (or more usually not act) from a place of fear, to be too eager to please and too scared to be seen. It's something that's difficult to rationalise yourself out of because you already know it's not rational. You're not on the FBI's most wanted list but you're always ready to feel guilty at the drop of a hat. 

I first became fascinated with the mind when looking at my own irrational thoughts and feelings. I became a hypnotherapist because it enables me to work with that part of the brain that logic alone can't reach. To be able to make changes at a deep level of feeling which is beyond words but drives how we react and interact in the world. Hypnosis is almost like resetting the levels back to the factory default before life happened and those unhelpful ideas and feelings got into your head. It's been a fascinating journey so far seeing how something so simple and natural can make such a difference to how a person experiences themselves and the world. I get to see people thrive and flourish being themselves and to me that's the most rewarding job I could have.
