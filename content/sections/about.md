Hi I'm Rachel and I love to help people improve their self esteem and confidence so they can be themselves in the world and enjoy life. Living in the grip of fear and doubt that's all in your own mind can leave you feeling hopeless and even stupid. But it's not your fault, it's just how the mind works. I became a hynotherapist so I could work with that deeper, less rational part of the mind to help people make changes they simply couldn't do  consciously. It's worked for me and the people I've helped. If you'd like to find out more have a look around the website. When you're ready to say goodbye to that old fear and doubt let me know.
