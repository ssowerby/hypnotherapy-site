title: Will I be in control?
---
This question usually comes from the world of stage hypnosis. Remember when someone goes up on stage they have a pretty good idea what's going to happen and they've agreed to participate in a performance. In a hypnotherapy session the hypnotherapist gives therapeutic directions and suggestions but it's up to you whether you want to agree to follow. Even in trance you will still be aware, able to move and talk when you wish but whatâ€™s happening inside your mind may be more absorbing than the outside world.
