title: How does hypnotherapy help?
---
Hypnotherapy helps by making changes on the unconscious level. We all have a part of our brain which runs below the level of conscious thought. It keeps your blood pumping, regulates your breathing, moves the muscles in your legs to walk. 

When you learn something well enough that it becomes automatic such as tying your shoe laces, driving a car, keeping your hands away from fire, the activity is taken over by the unconscious part of your mind which creates an automatic programme so you don't have to think about it consciously. When it works well it saves us a lot of conscious effort. 

However sometimes the processes that the mind makes automatic aren't useful such as panicking every time you have to speak in public or interpreting anything that doesn't work out as meaning you're stupid. With hypnotherapy we can reach this unconscious part of the mind and correct unhelpful programmes.
